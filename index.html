    <p><b><u>Kim's Notes</u></b></p>

<p></p><b>1 - Basics of the Web:</b><br>
- HTML<br>
- URLs<br>
- HTTP<br>
- Web apps</p>

<p><b>2 - WWW (World Wide Web)</b><br>
- a collection of HTML docs (HTML = hyper text markup language), that glue everything together<br>
- invented in the early 90s<br>
- 30+ billion pages<br>
- links (hyper linkgs) create the web</p>

<p><b>3 - Major "pieces" of the web:</b><br>
- you :)<br>
- PC/Comp running a browser<br>
- the internet<br>
- servers<br><br>

<i>The internet and servers talk to each other through http.</i><p>

<p><b>4 - HTML - hyper text markup language, made up of...</b>
- text content - what you can see<br>
- markup - what it looks like<br>
- references to other docs (images/videos, etc.)<br>
- links to other pages<br>
- HTML - hyper text markup language, made up of --</b><br><br>

<i>HTML markup is made of <u><b>tags</b></u>. There is an opening tag, followed by content, and then a closing tag. Each tag is named by a tag description within brackets. An entire tag is called an <u><b>element</b></u>.</i></p>

<p><b>5 - HTML attributes</b><br>
- tag attributes ascribe a value<br>
- tags can have multiple values<br><br>

<i>An example of an <u><b>attribute</b></u> assigned to a tag is an anchor. <u><b>Anchors</b></u> are for making links, like assigning a URL as an attribute to piece of content.</i></p>

<p><b>5a - Image tags</b><br>
- Unlike other tags, image tags don't have a closing tag. This is called a voide tag, because it has no content.<br>
- Alternate text can be assigned to display when the image doesn't load - this isn't required, but is good coding citizenry.<br></p>

<p><b>5b - Whitespace</b><br>
- All line spaces must be defined, forcing line breaks through tags.<br>
- Void tags like br don't need a close; but paragraph tags do need a close<br></p>

<p><b>5c - Inline or block</b><br>
- inline tags are used to simply end a line of text, and are void tags like line break = br<br>
- block tags make an invisible box for the text, and these can be assigned height and width<br></p>

<p><b>5d - Span/Div</b><br>
- span represents text, and is an inline tag<br>
- div represents text, and is a block tag; it behaves like a paragraph and creates a box around the tagged section.<br></p>

<p><b>6 - An HTML Document</b><br>
- first, doctype specifies the type of document at the beginning<br>
- next is an opening doc tag, like html to indicate the beginning of the doc<br>
- then attributes like head, title, etc., where you would define CSS guidelines<br>
- after the head and title tags, the body of the document is coded<br>
- once completed, a closing html tag is included</p>
